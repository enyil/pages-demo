## What are GitHub issues?

They’re kind of like email—except they can be shared and discussed with the rest of your team. Most software projects have a bug tracker of some kind. GitHub’s tracker is called Issues, and has its own section in every repository.

### You can use issues to

- Collect user feedback
- Report software bugs
- Record meeting notes
- Organize tasks you'd like to accomplish with issues in a repository
- Discuss tactical and strategic points with other stakeholders

### Searching issues

Search and manage your issues more effectively. You can filter your search results by author, label, projects, milestones, assignee, and open/closed state. You can also use the search bar to search for keywords within the content.

## Working with issues

With issues, you can:

- Track and prioritize your work using project boards.
- Create issue templates to help contributors open meaningful issues.
- You can link a pull request to an issue to show that the corresponding work is in progress and to automatically close the issue when someone merges the pull request.
- You can pin up to three important issues above the issues list in your repository.
- You can use task lists to create a list of items with checkboxes within pull request and issue comments. • You can use issue attachments to upload images of proposed features or screenshots of bugs.
- To stay updated on the most recent comments in an issue, you can watch an issue to receive notifications about the latest comments.
