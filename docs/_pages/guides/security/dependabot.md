If GitHub discovers vulnerable dependencies in your project, you can view them on the Dependabot alerts tab of your repository. Then, you can update your project to resolve or dismiss the vulnerability.

Repository administrators and organization owners can view and update dependencies.

Your repository's GitHub Dependabot alerts tab lists all open and closed GitHub Dependabot alerts and corresponding GitHub Dependabot security updates. You can sort the list of alerts using the drop-down menu, and you can click into specific alerts for more details. For more information, see [About alerts for vulnerable dependencies](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-alerts-for-vulnerable-dependencies).

You can enable automatic security updates for any repository that uses GitHub Dependabot alerts and the dependency graph. For more information, see [Configuring GitHub Dependabot security updates](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/configuring-github-dependabot-security-updates).
