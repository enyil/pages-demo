### Adding Users Through *People*

Official documentation on inviting users can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/inviting-users-to-join-your-organization).

* Open the [{{ site.org.name }}]({{ site.org.link }}) organization
* Navigate to *People*
![people location](imgs/manage-users.1.png)
* Select *Invite member*
![invite members button location](imgs/invite-users.1.png)
* Add the users email and click *Invite*  
**Note:** We do *NOT* invite users by GitHub Username due to the fact that typos can cause unwanted users to have access to the organization
