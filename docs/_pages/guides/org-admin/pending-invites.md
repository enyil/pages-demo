### Review Pending Invites

Often it is useful to determine if a user has an invite pending and who invited them.  Official documentation is located [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/canceling-or-editing-an-invitation-to-join-your-organization).

* Open the [{{ site.org.name }}]({{ site.org.link }}) organization
* Navigate to *People*

* Look through the pending invites to find the user in question
* Select the *Gear* icon next to the user
* Select *Edit invitation* from the new dropdown
